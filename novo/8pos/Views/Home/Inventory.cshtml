        <p>
            Inventory management is a vital issue and absorbs often substantial part of the operating budget of an organization. The lower the inventory level required for a production system able to work, it is more efficient, since these early not add value to the product.
            <br><br>
            The efficiency in its administration can create the difference against competitors. Improving production quality, reduced operating times, the careful reduction of costs, among other things, are some examples of actions that provide competitive advantages for the company.
            <br><br>
            In this sense, it is essential that companies reduce the amount of inventory in the supply chain in order to obtain a rationalization in storage costs and maintenance.
            <br><br>
            In short, one of the biggest obstacles in the inventory of retail business management, consumer goods and other industries is to achieve a quality level required in the integrity of inventory information, enabling professionals working in the management of proper inventory levels making right decisions at the right moment and with minimal divergence possible. Thus, the inventory count process has a key role to achieve this level of quality information as desired.
            <br><br>
            The inventory count, despite being a necessary activity for the control and effective inventory management of a company, is an activity that takes time, lots of money and makes even more complex the retail operations, industries, distribution centers and many others links in the supply chain. In addition, incomplete procedures, failures in the procedures, lack of training and other problems generate numerous inventory errors, affecting all stages of the supply chain.
            <br><br>
            Find ways that require little investment, that are efficient to perform the counting and ensure efficiency in the control of information in inventories has been the main goal of our system.

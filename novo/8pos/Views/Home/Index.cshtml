        <h1>Who is 8POS?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Simply put? We’re a smarter Point of Sale company. Technology is always changing. And that’s exactly what 8POS
            is all about.
        </p>
        <p>
            8 POS started in Brazil in 2010 and grew to become then # 1 distributor of POS solutions in the market. When
            8POS expanded their operations to the US, we observed the frustration of business owners whose needs were
            not being met by POS systems. Software providers at the time were focused on industry-specific and size-specific
            solutions. Making matters worse, even after a sizable investment in such systems most hardworking, responsible
            business owners were wasting days and weeks re-entering system data to 8POS accounting products, or paying
            a high-priced CPA once a year to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we started working on 8POS, we had one clear aim – to provide retailers with an all-in-one solution to conveniently
            manage their business anytime, anywhere with state of the art built in fraud detection tools. 8POS lets you
            sell across all channels – in-store, online and on the go – and manage every aspect of your business. We
            are at the forefront of innovation in this industry, and that’s where we intend to stay.
        </p>
        <p>
            We asked ourselves, “What if there was a way to give every cashier in retail the same fast and familiar interface
            for serving customers – but which allowed every business owner to choose the ideal, preferred back end for
            them?”. Our research soon led us to discovering the wonderfully diverse invoicing and reporting capabilities
            of worldwide 8POS products. We soon realized our idea had even more potential. Turning easily gathered Point
            of Sale data directly into paid accounting invoices would mean that a CPA’s work is essentially done.
